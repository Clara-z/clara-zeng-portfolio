    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/me.png"
    content: |-
      I'm an early-career Data Scientist and AI Engineer with a strong foundation in machine learning, natural language processing, and full-stack development. I recently graduated from USC with a degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics (GPA: 3.94/4.0), and I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Analytics at UC Berkeley.

      I'm passionate about leveraging AI and data to create impactful solutions—from building ML microservices for financial predictions to developing privacy-preserving techniques for large language models.
