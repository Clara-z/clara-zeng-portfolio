## Overview

At Bluebono, I designed and implemented a comprehensive loan-to-value estimation and market-score evaluation pipeline for residential properties. This project covered the full data science lifecycle from project scoping and data acquisition to model deployment.

## Key Contributions

### Data Acquisition & Vendor Management

Directed dataset acquisition efforts by:
- Evaluating multiple data vendors and their offerings
- Negotiating contracts for optimal pricing and data access
- Integrating a real-time data feed from the **California Regional Multiple Listing Service (CRMLS)** via the Trestle API

This established a reliable, up-to-date data pipeline for property information across California.

### Large-Scale Data Engineering

Engineered and processed a massive dataset consisting of:
- **11.3 million property records**
- **1,000+ market features** per property

This required building robust ETL pipelines capable of handling data at scale while maintaining data quality and consistency.

### Feature Engineering & Dimensionality Reduction

Applied unsupervised feature clustering techniques to:
- Group highly correlated variables together
- Reduce dimensionality by **65%**
- Improve model interpretability without sacrificing predictive power

This approach made the resulting models more explainable for business stakeholders while maintaining strong performance.

## Technical Stack

- **Data Processing:** Python, Pandas, SQL
- **APIs:** Trestle API (CRMLS)
- **ML Techniques:** Unsupervised Clustering, Feature Selection
- **Scale:** 11.3M+ records, 1000+ features

## Impact

The pipeline I built enables Bluebono to provide accurate property valuations and market scores, helping clients make informed decisions in the competitive California real estate market.
