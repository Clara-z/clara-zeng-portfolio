## Overview

At Cmind AI, I work as an Associate Data Scientist focusing on building production-ready machine learning systems for financial applications. My work spans from architecting ML microservices to developing end-to-end NLP pipelines.

## Key Projects

### ML Microservices Architecture

Architected and deployed modular machine-learning microservices for feature selection, class imbalance handling, and model training. This microservices approach enables independent scaling and significantly reduces production failure risk by isolating components.

**Technologies:** Python, Docker, REST APIs, Cloud Infrastructure

### Earnings Per Share (EPS) Surprise Prediction System

Enhanced the company's flagship EPS Surprise Prediction system by implementing automated retraining pipelines. I trained and evaluated multiple model architectures including:

- **XGBoost** - For gradient boosting on structured financial data
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** - For classification tasks
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** - For capturing temporal patterns in sequential data

The system processes 15+ years of historical financial data and achieves **90% quarterly forecast accuracy**.

### Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

Led development of a customizable end-to-end sentiment-analysis pipeline featuring:

- **FinBERT integration** - Fine-tuned BERT model for financial domain text
- **OpenAI APIs** - For tailored Q&A with explanations
- **Oracle Cloud ingestion** - For cost-efficient legacy-system compatibility
- **AWS S3 storage** - Supporting smooth migration to modern analytics workflows

### MLOps & Experiment Tracking

Leveraged MLflow throughout all projects for:
- Experiment tracking and comparison
- Model version control
- Deployment monitoring
- Ensuring reproducibility and compliance with internal MLOps standards

## Skills Developed

- Feature Selection & Engineering
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Class Imbalance Handling
- MLOps Best Practices
- Financial Domain NLP
- Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, Oracle)
