## Overview

Advanced to semi-finals among 40+ teams in the Tesla Global Sourcing Strategy Case Competition, presenting supply chain optimization strategies to Tesla executives.

## The Challenge

Tesla faced a critical decision regarding a key vehicle component affected by 25% tariff impacts. The challenge was to optimize sourcing across three manufacturing locations:

- **United States** - Domestic production
- **Mexico** - USMCA trade benefits
- **China** - Established supply chain infrastructure

## My Approach

### Cost-Optimization Model

Built a comprehensive cost-optimization model analyzing a **$200M+ sourcing decision** across multiple scenarios:

- Analyzed five-year unit costs under various tariff scenarios
- Modeled production capacity constraints at each site
- Incorporated logistics and transportation costs
- Factored in currency exchange rate fluctuations

### Monte Carlo Simulation

Implemented Monte Carlo simulation to:

- Quantify uncertainty in demand forecasts
- Model tariff escalation probabilities
- Assess supply chain disruption risks
- Calculate confidence intervals for cost projections

### Key Finding: Operational Flexibility Value

Quantified **$18.7M in operational flexibility value** through:

- Strategic site selection enabling production shifting
- Multi-plant switching options to hedge against disruptions
- Scenario-based contingency planning

## Strategic Recommendation

Delivered a recommendation balancing:

1. **Cost Minimization** - Optimal allocation across sites
2. **Operational Flexibility** - Ability to shift production as conditions change
3. **Risk Hedging** - Protection against tariff escalation and supply chain disruptions

## Skills Applied

- Supply Chain Optimization
- Cost Model Development
