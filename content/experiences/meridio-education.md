## Overview

Developed a GPT-powered conversational system for Meridio, a web-based educational platform designed to help middle school students engage with math through AI-driven discussions and interactive simulations.

## The Vision

Traditional math education often fails to engage students. Meridio transforms learning by:

- Creating immersive, game-like environments for learning
- Using AI to provide personalized tutoring at scale
- Making math concepts tangible through interactive simulations
- Fostering collaboration among students in virtual spaces

## My Contributions

### GPT-Powered Conversational System

Developed the core AI interaction layer featuring:

- **Context-aware conversations** - The AI understands where the student is in their learning journey
- **Adaptive difficulty** - Questions and explanations adjust based on student responses
- **Encouraging feedback** - Positive reinforcement to keep students motivated

### Multi-User Collaboration

Built systems enabling students to:

- Work together in math-themed virtual spaces
- Share problem-solving approaches
- Learn from peer interactions
- Collaborate on complex challenges

### LLM Prompt Orchestration

Designed sophisticated prompt engineering systems for:

- Maintaining conversation context across sessions
- Generating age-appropriate explanations
- Creating engaging math problems dynamically
- Providing step-by-step guidance without giving away answers

### Safety Features

Implemented **profanity detection** and content filtering to ensure:

- A safe learning environment for middle schoolers
- Appropriate AI responses at all times
- Compliance with educational platform standards

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Game Engine:** Phaser.io
- **AI:** OpenAI GPT APIs
- **Key Skills:** Prompt Engineering, Real-time Systems

## Architecture Highlights

### Conversation Flow Management

```
User Input → Safety Filter → Context Manager → GPT API → Response Filter → User
```

### Real-time Collaboration

Built on WebSocket connections enabling:

- Instant updates across all connected students
- Synchronized game state
- Real-time chat and collaboration

## Impact

Meridio makes math education more accessible and engaging, particularly for students who struggle with traditional teaching methods. The AI tutor provides patient, personalized instruction that scales to thousands of students simultaneously.
