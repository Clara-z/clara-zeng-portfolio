## Experience

### Cmind AI | Associate Data Scientist
**May 2024 – Sep 2025**

- Architected and deployed modular machine-learning microservices for feature selection, class imbalance handling, and model training, enabling independent scaling and reducing production failure risk.
- Enhanced the Earnings Per Share Surprise Prediction system by implementing automated retraining pipelines, training XGBoost, SVM, & RNN models on 15+ years of financial data to achieve 90% quarterly forecast accuracy.
- Led development of a customizable end-to-end sentiment-analysis pipeline using FinBERT (financial domain) and OpenAI APIs for tailored Q&A with explanations; designed Oracle Cloud ingestion for cost-efficient legacy-system compatibility and AWS S3 storage to support a smooth migration to modern client-facing analytics workflows.
- Leveraged MLflow for experiment tracking, model version control, and deployment monitoring, ensuring reproducibility, transparency, and compliance with internal MLOps standards.

### Bluebono | Data Analyst Intern
**June – Aug 2025**

- Designed and implemented a loan-to-value estimation and market-score evaluation pipeline for residential properties, covering the full workflow from project scoping and data acquisition to model deployment.
- Directed dataset acquisition efforts by evaluating vendors, negotiating contracts, and integrating a real-time data feed from the California Regional Multiple Listing Service (CRMLS) via the Trestle API.
- Engineered and processed 11.3M property records with over 1,000 market features; applied unsupervised feature clustering to group correlated variables, reducing dimensionality by 65% and improving model interpretability.

### Guangfa Futures | Quantitative Analyst Intern
**June – Aug 2023**

- Applied regression, time-series and K-Means clustering models to identify predictive patterns in futures markets.
- Performed sensitivity analyses to quantify volatility impacts, developed monthly and quarterly forecasting models, and delivered actionable reports to support trading strategy decisions.

## Research and Project Experience

### AI-Based Career Advisor
**Jan – May 2025**

- Designed and developed an interactive AI-based tool to help users plan and explore career paths and provide real-time applicable links by leveraging user-input skills and interests. Deployed a Streamlit UI for streamlined user interaction.
- Utilized large language models (GPT APIs and Llama3) and 1.3 million entries datasets (O*NET, LinkedIn) for career path recommendations and real-time skill gap analysis, providing specific learning resources to bridge identified gaps.

### Super Computing In Pocket (SCIP) Lab
**Jan 2024 – May 2025**

- Conducted research on privacy-preserving knowledge distillation for large language models, aligning attention and hidden layers between GPT-2 and DistilGPT2 and integrating Differentially Private SGD to enhance data confidentiality without significant loss in performance, ensuring data protection.
- Re-engineered and optimized a text dataset distillation framework using Hugging Face models; redesigned data-loading pipelines and initiated a full algorithm reimplementation to enable integration with differential privacy mechanisms.

### Hate Speech Detection Project
**Aug – Dec 2023**

- Implemented and optimized Naive Bayes and BERT models for hate speech detection on social media, applying k-fold cross-validation, early stopping, & extensive preprocessing to achieve 92% accuracy on a dynamically generated dataset.
